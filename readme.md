# discrete_hitbox
A library that provides hitbox checks based on arbitrary discrete shape representations. A shape is modelled using a variable amount of lines.

This is a learner project, it is first one that I write using the rust language.

## Features

* Point inclusion checks (in progress)
* Polygon clipping (TODO)
